HHHHHAAAAAAWWWWWWW!!!!!! 😳😳😳
How can you be angry at me, at such a cute little baby? 🥺🥺
Chalo koi ni, jaisi bhi hu tumhari hu na! Fir kaisa gussa 😌
Theek hai chalo, I'm sorry for whatever I did or whatever you think I did😝
But on a serious note, whatever it is, it will pass. Because our love is waayyyy stronger than whatever stupid thing we got ourselves into. These past 3 years we have 
gotten out of so many ugly situations and we have always come out stronger. Because baby, our love for each other is pure and precious. I am sorry if I have hurt you. It will never ever be intentional. I swear. Because your smile is my most favourite thing in the world and I hate that it's gone because of me. You have got a smile that can light up this whole town. 
Things will get better, I know it because we will work hard for i. We are endgame baby and no issue or problem will stand in the way of that.
So now, stop being so stubborn and smile for me please, pick up your phone and give me a callbeacsue I am 100% sure I would be fretting over it too.
Let's talk about it and sort it out.
I love you so much! ❤️
