My Love,
If you’re opening this, I want you to pause for a second and feel just how deeply you are cherished.🫠
I love you more than the number of stars in the night sky.
More than the seconds we’ve shared together — and the infinite ones I still hope we’ll share.
I love you in ways words can’t fully capture, but I’ll try anyway…

I love the way your smile brightens my day, even before the sun rises.
I love your laughter — it's music I never get tired of.
I love your quirks, your thoughts, your dreams… especially your sleepy voice in the morning.

I love the way you make everything feel like home and how you feel like my safe space and my home ❤️
You are the reason ordinary moments become beautiful memories.
You are the calm in my chaos and the spark in my quiet.

And no matter what the world throws our way, one thing will never change:
I will always, always love you.♥️♥️♥️
