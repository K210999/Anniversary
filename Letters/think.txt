BABY? No! No overthinking!
Take a deep breath with me. I know your beautiful mind can get caught in loops‚Äîreplaying scenarios, imagining worst cases, questioning every little thing. But right now, I want you to pause and just reflect.
You don‚Äôt need to have everything figured out. You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. And you definitely don‚Äôt need to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. Especially not alone. I'm right besides you.

When your thoughts are racing, I hope you can hear my voice whispering:
‚ÄúYou don't have to do it alone, Soums. I love you and I am always with you!‚Äùüòò

Not everything has to make sense right now. Some things are meant to be felt, not solved. I trust you. I trust your heart, your instincts, and your intentions‚Äîeven when you doubt them yourself. 
You are born to achieve great things because you are an amazing person and I am your biggest cheerleader.ü•≥

So if you're spiraling, come back to this truth:
You are doing your best, and that is more than enough.üíï

Let go of what you can‚Äôt control, and let me hold the rest for you.
I‚Äôm always here‚Äîcalm in your storm, peace in your noise, love in your chaos.‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
