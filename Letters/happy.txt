Umm hmm! To sahab ji aaj taareefein sunne k mood mei hai. 😝
Firstly, let's start by saying, I am irrevocably in love with you Soums! You are my heartbeat.♥️
I know it may seem at times that I have ungrateful or I only think about the bad moments. But, my love, that is the farthest thing from the truth. 
Everyday, I am more and more grateful to have you in my life and to be yours. And I remember all the good times we have had together. 
Whether it's up close or when we're far. I remember.

You went from the guy who would even recoil with just a thought of sharing a spoonw to the one who would do it readily.
From trying to pry about your personal life to you actively sharing it, we have come a long way.
The way you have changed, just to make me happy is something I would never take for granted.
I still remember you calling me up before your exams or important events and saying,"Gols paer dikha na!"; making me feel like your devi💝🥺
Or you traveling for so long just to meet me for some time whenever I was in Delhi or dropping me off till my home because you were worried about me.
You remeber, when we danced on the Bangalore streets at midnight because we saw something romantic on instagrama and wanted to recreate it🥹🥹
There have been sooo many moments where you've made me the happiest girl, madly in love." Like getting me flowers and balloons and decorating the room in sticky notes
  with the sweetest messages before taking me on a date. Or being equally jhalla with me when I was a little tunn and for putting up with it.
The way you try to make time for me every single day even when you're super busy, just so we can talk is something I love about you.♥️
I remember all our online dates, getting ready to watch a movie and order for each other and then ending up doing something else instead of watching the movie😈
The way you used to stay on video calls with me for hours, watching me dance and just talking to me used to make my day or when you used to act all funny just to make me smile! 💕💕
One of my most favourite memories of us is from Jaipur when we just got our noodles and watched big boss while eating in bed and having one of the most relaxing and sweetest time together.
Or going to the arcade with you and playing all the games and beating you in all those 😝
I always see you Ssoums. I see everything you do for me. So if I ever get mad at you for not doing something, that never negates any of the things you have actually done for me.
  Like getting me soo many books, I have not read a single book online ever since we started dating, Surprising me on my birthday with a books bouquet(dreamyyy) 
or getting me flowers for valentines day, getting me the cutest unicorn just because or getting my face on a tshirt and actually wearing it for me🤗🤗🤗
You try to make me happy in your own way and for that I am always grateful! 
You are my lifeline Soums. Please don't ever forget that! 💝💝💝
