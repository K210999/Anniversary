I know today may have felt longer than usual. The weight of the world sometimes presses harder, and even your strong shoulders need a break. If I could, I‚Äôd wrap you in the tightest hug, rest your head on my chest, and let the silence between us heal whatever words can‚Äôt.

You don‚Äôt always have to carry everything on your own. I see how hard you try, how much you give, and how rarely you ask for anything in return. I want you to know ‚Äî I am always here. To listen, to hold, to be your calm after the storm.

Take a deep breath. Let go of the day. And remind yourself: tomorrow is a fresh start, and no matter what, you have someone who believes in you endlessly.
I love you to Hupiter and back üåç
