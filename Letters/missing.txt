Hi Love,
If you're reading this, I'm guessing you're feeling that little ache in your heart — the one I feel too when we're apart.🥺🥺
First, take a deep breath
Now imagine me wrapping my arms around you, holding you tight, whispering,
“I love you Soums and I'm right here, always.”🫂
I miss you too — more than words can say.
But just because you can’t see me doesn’t mean I’m not thinking about you.
You live in my heart, in my thoughts, in every beat and breath of my day.💕

Think of all the memories we’ve made — the laughs, the kisses, the quiet moments when just being near was enough.
Now think of all the memories we still have to create. Places we have to explore, things we have to try, beautiful moments we have to capture.
Because this isn’t the end of anything — it’s just a pause between more beautiful chapters.

When you miss me, remember:
I’m only ever one call, one message, one memory away.
The love we share bridges any distance, any silence, any time apart.
I love you more with every second — near or far.

So smile for me, my love. I’m smiling for you too.
And I’ll be holding you in my heart… until I’m holding you in my arms again.
Always and always yours!
