Tumhe dekhte hi chehra
Yun khil jata hai,
jaise tumhare hone se mujhe
sab kuch mil jaata hai!
Kaise btau ki tu, kya ho mere liye
Tumhe bass ek baar dekh lu
Toh mera poora din bann jaata hai ♥️

I know you're feeling down right now, and if I could, I’d wrap you up in the biggest, warmest hug and hold you until every bit of sadness faded away.🥺🫂
Sometimes the world can feel heavy, and it’s okay to feel overwhelmed. But I want you to remember something very important: you are never alone. I’m always here—whether to talk, to listen, or to just sit silently beside you while you feel your feelings. And I might not always be able to do an excellent job at it but
I would always have teh best intentions in my heart for you. 💕

You're one of the strongest, kindest souls I know. Your heart is so full of light, even when it feels dim. And on days like this, I hope you remember how deeply you're loved—not just for your smiles and laughter, but for every part of you, even the teary-eyed, quiet moments.

So take a deep breath, my love. Let yourself rest. Cry if you need to. The sun will shine again, and I’ll be right here, always. Or better yet, give me a call 
and I will try my best to make you feel better. 💝
I love you more than you’ll ever know.🫂🫂
